## POST 1: Main Announcement (Copy-Paste Ready)

🚀 I built an AI-powered Job Market Intelligence Platform from scratch.

It does what enterprise tools like LinkedIn Talent Insights ($50K/year) and Lightcast ($100K/year) do.

My cost? $3 in API calls.

Here's what it actually does:

---

🤖 THE AI COMPONENT

This is where it gets interesting.

I used a hybrid approach:

𝟭. 𝗥𝘂𝗹𝗲-𝗯𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗲𝘅𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 (24,500 skills)
→ Pattern matching with word boundaries
→ 150+ predefined technical & soft skills
→ High precision, catches explicit mentions

𝟮. 𝗚𝗣𝗧-𝟰 𝗟𝗟𝗠 𝗲𝗻𝗿𝗶𝗰𝗵𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 (3,220 skills)
→ Reads job descriptions contextually
→ Infers IMPLIED skills not explicitly mentioned
→ Adds confidence scores (0.7-1.0)

Example of LLM inference:

Job says: "Build scalable data pipelines for our cloud infrastructure"

Rule-based finds: "data pipeline", "cloud"

GPT-4 infers: "Python" (0.9), "Airflow" (0.85), "AWS" (0.8), "Spark" (0.75)

This added 3,220 skills that keyword matching completely missed.

Enterprise market intelligence: $50K-$100K/year
This platform: $3 total (API costs)

Not because enterprise tools are overpriced.
But because the technology is now accessible to everyone.

When a job says "build scalable systems"—AI knows that implies Python, AWS, Docker.

That's the power of contextual understanding.

## POST 3: Story Format (Highest Engagement)

---

6 months ago, I was frustrated.

Every "Top Skills for 2024" article was based on opinions.
Not data.

HR teams were guessing what to put in job descriptions.
Job seekers were learning skills that didn't matter.
Recruiters couldn't spot trends until it was too late.

So I decided to build something.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗴𝗼𝗮𝗹: Analyze the actual job market with AI.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁: A platform that analyzed 18,079 jobs and extracted 27,720 skills.

Here's what I learned building it:

---

𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝟭: 𝗞𝗲𝘆𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗱 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝘀𝗻'𝘁 𝗲𝗻𝗼𝘂𝗴𝗵

Job description: "Build scalable data infrastructure"

What keywords find: "data"
What AI finds: Python, Spark, AWS, Airflow, Docker

GPT-4 added 3,220 skills that pattern matching missed.

---

𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝟮: 𝗦𝗼𝗳𝘁 𝘀𝗸𝗶𝗹𝗹𝘀 𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗿𝗲

"Problem-solving" appears in 40% of all jobs.
"Collaboration" in 35%.
"Communication" in 30%.

But nobody tracks them because they're hard to extract.

AI changes that.

---

𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝟯: 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁 𝗺𝗼𝘃𝗲𝘀 𝗳𝗮𝘀𝘁

In IT: Python > Java (by 28%)
In Finance: Compliance > Everything else
Everywhere: Cloud skills = higher salary

---

𝗟𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗼𝗻 𝟰: 𝗬𝗼𝘂 𝗱𝗼𝗻'𝘁 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱 $𝟱𝟬𝗞 𝘁𝗼𝗼𝗹𝘀

Total cost of this project: $3
Time to build: 2 weeks
Skills used: Python, SQL, GPT-4, Power BI

The same tech that powers enterprise tools
is now available to everyone.

---

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁'𝘀 𝗻𝗲𝘅𝘁:

Automating weekly refreshes with AWS Lambda.
Soon I'll be able to say:
"Kubernetes demand increased 25% this quarter"

That's real competitive intelligence.
